# Demo Word Count Package for Atom

This package toggles a UI modal showing the word count in the current buffer. The development of this package follows the steps in [Package: Word Count](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/package-word-count) section within chapter 3 of the Atom Flight Manual.

To test this package in your local Atom install, save the contents in a directory inside your `.atom/packages`, which is located either off of user home or as a sibling to the application if you're running Atom in portable mode.
